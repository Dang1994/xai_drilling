## Explainable-AI_Drilling
## Drilling Process Parameter Optimization and Explainable AI (XAI) for ROP Prediction

## üìå Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between drilling process parameters using two distinct datasets. The primary objectives are:
- Developing Explainable AI (XAI) models using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) with XGBoost and Random Forest.
- Predicting the Rate of Penetration (ROP) using machine learning models.
- Optimizing process parameters for ROP using various optimization techniques, including Bayesian Optimization, Genetic Algorithms (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), and Simulated Annealing (SA).

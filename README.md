# **Explainable AI Techniques with XGBoost and Other Models**

In this repository, I am working on applying **Explainable AI (XAI)** techniques to various machine learning models. The primary model I am using is **XGBoost**, a powerful and efficient gradient boosting model, alongside other models for comparison.

### **Key Highlights:**
- **XGBoost Model**: I implement and evaluate XGBoost for prediction tasks.
- **Explainable AI Techniques**: 
  - **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** for understanding model predictions.
  - **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** for feature importance and model transparency.
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: I apply various preprocessing techniques and create new features to enhance model performance.

Here I demonstrate how XAI techniques can improve model interpretability and build trust in AI-driven predictions.

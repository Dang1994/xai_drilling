# 🩺 Health Score Prediction Project

## 📌 Project Overview  

My aim here is to develop a machine learning tool to predict health scores based on lifestyle factors like age, BMI, exercise frequency, diet quality, sleep patterns, smoking status, and alcohol consumption. By analyzing these relationships, I'll create data-driven health insights to support better lifestyle decisions.

**Key Components:**  
1. **Predictive Modeling:**  
   - Multiple regression models to quantify health impacts  
   - Feature importance analysis to identify key health drivers  

2. **Deployment:**  
   - Flask/FastAPI backend serving the trained model  
   - Interactive Streamlit/Dash dashboard featuring:  
     * Health score calculator with sliders/input fields  
     * Visualizations of how different habits affect scores  #TODO
     * Personalized improvement recommendations  #TODO
   - Optionally deployed via Heroku/Streamlit Cloud for public access  #TODO

|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `Age`                 | Age in years (continuous)                          |
| `BMI`                 | Body Mass Index (continuous)                       |
| `Exercise_Frequency` | Number of exercise days per week (0–7)             |
| `Diet_Quality`        | Healthiness score of diet (0–100)                  |
| `Sleep_Hours`         | Average sleep per night (in hours)                 |
| `Smoking_Status`      | 0 = Non-smoker, 1 = Smoker                         |
| `Alcohol_Consumption` | Alcohol units consumed per week (continuous)      |
| `Health_Score`        | Target variable (0–100), representing overall health |


## 🔧 Key Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing  
To begin, I’ll clean and prepare the dataset by:  
- Handling any **missing values**  
- Encoding **categorical features** like `Smoking_Status`  
- Applying **feature scaling** for better model performance  
- Performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to discover patterns and correlations

### 2️⃣ Model Building & Training  
I plan to experiment with multiple supervised learning models to predict the health score. These include:

- ✅ **Linear Regression** – My baseline model for comparison  
- 🌳 **Random Forest Regressor** – To handle non-linear relationships  
- 🔥 **Gradient Boosting Regressor** – An ensemble method for boosting performance  
- 📈 **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)** – Effective for complex data structures  
- ⚡ **XGBoost Regressor** – A powerful and efficient gradient boosting technique that often delivers top-tier performance

Each model will be trained, validated, and fine-tuned for optimal prediction accuracy.

### 3️⃣ Model Evaluation  
To evaluate my models, I’ll use the following performance metrics:  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
- **R² Score** (to measure explained variance)

## 🚀 Future Plans  
Here are some additional directions I’m considering:  
- Performing **hyperparameter tuning** with Grid Search or Randomized Search  
- Visualizing feature importance using **SHAP or LIME**  
- Building an **interactive dashboard** or health recommendation app  
- Extending the dataset with additional features like genetics, chronic conditions, or mental health indicators
